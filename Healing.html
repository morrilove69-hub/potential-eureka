    <h1>Begin by Sitting Alone</h1>
    <p>We truly do not know ourselves until we've spent time with ourselves first.</p>
    <p>Start by trying an activity you loved as a child similar to painting or building blocks.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself, "Do I still enjoy this? What do I enjoy in it? What could make this a better experience?"</p>
    <p>Now try a healthy activity you did as a teen</p>
    <p>ask, "Do I like this? Do I still have a good time doing this?"</p>
    <p>Take your time and ruminate on these questions.</p>
    <p>Truly, are you still having fun doing these activities? Is this still fun?</p>
    <p>Now that you've connected with your inner child and your inner teen; how do you feel?</p>
    <p>What are some other activities that relate to the great ones I've experienced?</p>
    <p>How can I integrate them into my daily life?</p>
